# Chicken and Rice Recipe  

## Ingredients  
- 1 chicken breast  
- 1 cup rice  
- 2 cups water  
- 1 tablespoon olive oil  
- Omaha Steaks seasoning (to taste)  

## Equipment  
- Pot  
- Skillet  

## Instructions  
1. **Cook the rice**: In a pot, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Add 1 cup of rice, cover, and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for about 18-20 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed.  
2. **Cook the chicken**: While the rice is cooking, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Season the chicken breast with Omaha Steaks seasoning, and cook for 6-7 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink in the center. Remove from the skillet and slice into strips.  
3. **Combine**: Serve the sliced chicken over the cooked rice.
