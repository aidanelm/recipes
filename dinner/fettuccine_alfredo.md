# Fettuccine Alfredo Recipe  

## Ingredients  
- 1 cup dry fettuccine pasta  
- 1/2 cup heavy cream  
- 2 tablespoons butter  
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese  
- *Optional:* 1 chicken breast  

## Equipment  
- Pot  
- Skillet (if adding chicken)  
- Strainer  
- Saucepan  
- Whisk  

## Instructions  
1. **Cook the pasta**: Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the dry fettuccine and cook according to package instructions, typically 8-10 minutes, until al dente. Drain and set aside.  
2. **Cook the chicken (optional)**: If adding chicken, heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook the chicken breast for 6-7 minutes per side, or until fully cooked. Remove from the skillet and slice into strips.  
3. **Make the Alfredo sauce**: In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the heavy cream and whisk until combined. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 2-3 minutes. Stir in the Parmesan cheese and continue whisking until the sauce is smooth and thickened.  
4. **Combine**: Toss the cooked fettuccine in the sauce, stirring to coat evenly. If using chicken, add the sliced pieces on top.
