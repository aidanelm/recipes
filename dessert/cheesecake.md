# Cheesecake Recipe  

## Ingredients  
### For the crust:  
- 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs  
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar  
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted  

### For the filling:  
- 4 (8 oz) packages cream cheese, softened  
- 1 cup granulated sugar  
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
- 4 large eggs  
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream  
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour  

## Equipment  
- 9-inch springform pan  
- Mixing bowls  
- Electric mixer or whisk  
- Rubber spatula  
- Aluminum foil  

## Instructions  
1. **Preheat oven**: Set the oven to 325°F (163°C).  
2. **Prepare the crust**: In a bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter. Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan to form a crust. Bake for 10 minutes, then remove and let cool while you prepare the filling.  
3. **Prepare the filling**: In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth and creamy. Add sugar and vanilla extract, and beat until combined.  
4. **Add eggs**: Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.  
5. **Add heavy whipping cream and flour**: Stir in heavy whipping cream and flour until fully combined.  
6. **Assemble**: Pour the cream cheese mixture over the cooled crust. Smooth the top with a spatula.  
7. **Bake**: Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center is still slightly jiggly.  
8. **Cool**: Let the cheesecake cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, wrap the bottom of the pan with aluminum foil to prevent water from seeping in, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.
