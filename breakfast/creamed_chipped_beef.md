# Creamed Chipped Beef Recipe  

## Ingredients  
- 1 jar (about 4 oz) chipped beef, sliced  
- 2 tablespoons butter  
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour  
- 1 cup milk  
- Wheat toast (for serving)  

## Equipment  
- Skillet  
- Whisk  
- Plate  

## Instructions  
1. **Prepare the chipped beef**: Rinse the chipped beef under cold water to remove excess salt, then slice it into bite-sized pieces.  
2. **Make the roux**: In a skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes, until it forms a smooth paste.  
3. **Add the milk**: Gradually add the milk to the roux while whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Cook for 3-5 minutes, or until the mixture thickens.  
4. **Add the chipped beef**: Stir in the sliced chipped beef and cook for another 2-3 minutes, until heated through.  
5. **Serve**: Spoon the creamed chipped beef over wheat toast.
