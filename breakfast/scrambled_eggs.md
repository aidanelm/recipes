## Ingredients  
- 2 large eggs  
- 1 tablespoon butter (or oil)

- Pepper to taste  

## Equipment  
- Bowl  
- Whisk or fork

## Instructions  
1. **Whisk the eggs**: Crack the eggs into a bowl. Add 1 tablespoon of milk and whisk until the mixture is smooth and fully combined.  
2. **Heat the skillet**: Place a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat and melt the butter (or heat the oil).
