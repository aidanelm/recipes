# Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Recipe  

## Ingredients  
- 2 slices of bacon  
- 1 large egg  
- 1 slice of cheddar cheese  
- 1 tablespoon butter (or oil)  
- 1 sliced bagel 

## Equipment  
- Skillet  
- Spatula

## Instructions  
1. **Cook the bacon**: Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook the bacon slices until crispy, flipping as needed. Remove from the skillet and place on a plate lined with paper towels to drain.  
2. **Toast the bagel**: Slice the bagel and toast it to your desired crispness.  
3. **Cook the egg**: Melt 1 tablespoon of butter (or heat oil) in the skillet. Crack the egg into the skillet and fry it until the white is fully set and the yolk is cooked through.

5. **Assemble**: Layer the bacon and cheesy egg between the toasted bagel halves.
